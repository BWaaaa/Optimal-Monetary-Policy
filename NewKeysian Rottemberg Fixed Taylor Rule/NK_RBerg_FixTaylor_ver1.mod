% This model does the work for log-linear New Keysian Model with a Taylor Rule pegged on a Fixed Long-run Output 
% (the steady state level, I will approximately take it as 0.98).
% 
% The reason for this simplification on Taylor Rule is to show an independent NK model, avoiding introducing the flex-path model, 
% which is required in a standard Taylor Rule implicitly by Y_tilda.

% sig (CRRA) can be crucial in deciding the correlation between H(labour) and Y(output). 
% If sig < 1, correlation (H,Y) usually is positive:
% This is explained by the fact that consumer are MORE elastic in intertemporal consumption, so they will produce and consume more with a positive productivity shock;
% If sig > 1, correlation(H,Y) usually is negative:
% This is explained by the fact that consumer is LESS elastic in intertemporal consumption, so they would rather enjoy more leisure with a positive productivity shock;

%  Computers are modest. They only report what they see. If i magnify the shocl to such a degree, it can see nothing, so it says nothing! Rubbish in, rubbsih out; gold in, gold out.
