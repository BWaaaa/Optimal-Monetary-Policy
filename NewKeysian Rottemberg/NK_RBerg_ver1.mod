% A: Aggregate Productivity;
% Y_til = Y/Yf;
% C: Aggregate Consumption;
% H: Aggregate Labour;
% w: real wage;
% MC: real marginal cost of intermediate good producer;
% R: Gross Nominal Interest Rate (R = 1+r), which is better for log-linearization for interpretation as percentage change;
% p: Gross Inflation Level: p = 1 + pi, which is better for log-linearization for more fundamential reason as steady pi = 0;
% Y: Aggregate Output (the real output level);

% Y_tilda: defined as logY_tilde = y_tilde = log(Y) - log(Yf), in which Yf is the ideal Aggregate Output under flex-price path, 
% With refer to the flex-path output, please go to document NewKeysian Basic Model/NK_Basics1_ver1.mod. 
% Also, see LN1 3.5.1, y_tilde is the log difference as defined on Page18 between the real output change, 
% and the ideal situation where there is no sticky price distrtion. The monopolistic distortion is maintained throughout.
% Equivilantly we get  Yf = Y/Y_tilde;

% sig (CRRA) can be crucial in deciding the correlation between H(labour) and Y(output). 
% If sig < 1, correlation (H,Y) usually is positive:
% This is explained by the fact that consumer are MORE elastic in intertemporal consumption, so they will produce and consume more with a positive productivity shock;
% If sig > 1, correlation(H,Y) usually is negative:
% This is explained by the fact that consumer is LESS elastic in intertemporal consumption, so they would rather enjoy more leisure with a positive productivity shock;

%  Note: please ensure the chock is mediated by s=0.05. Larger shocks will destroy the convergence because dynare uses stochastic simulation 
%  Intuitively, We will DESTROY the economy if we let the shock to have variance 1. Noted the steady state output is only 1, by such a great shock the economic will never go back to norm.

%  1 for the demand for labour given the production level, as the firm side FOC. See LN1 eq(20);
%  2 for optimized marginal cost as the firm side FOC. This in turn decides the total production level, so interpreted as supply for good. See LN1 eq(21);
%  3 for labour supply as the household side FOC. See LN1 eq(5),eq(6);
%  4 for Euler Equation on intertemporal choice based on nominal bond. See LN1 eq(5),eq(7);
%  5 for good demand from household (or good market constraint). See LN1 eq(41);
%  6 for Phillip Curve (or money market clearance). See LN1 eq(29);
%  7 for Exponential form of Taylor Rule;
%  8 for output under Flex Price Path, in taylor rule logY_tilda is defined as log(Y)-log(Y_FlexPricePath). 
%  9 for technology process, with reduced size of the shock!
%  10 to show monetary policy shock, with reduced size of the shock!
%  The s is a size adjustment to the productivity shock, which is CRUCIAL to this model to be around 0.05.
