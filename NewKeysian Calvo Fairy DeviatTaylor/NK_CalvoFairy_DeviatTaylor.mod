'SIMULATION FOR NEW KEYSIAN CALVO-FAIRY MODEL: DEVIATION TAYLOR RULE'
'Brian Wang'
% =========================================================================
% DESCRIPTION:
% This file contains New Keysian Calvo model, following Prof.Dennis's LN1
%
% Deviation Taylor Rule: CB sets nominal interest rate with a trade-off 
% between deviation of output from Flex-Price Path level and inflation. 
% Flex-Price Path: This is when prices are totally flexible, and therefore 
% no inflation and no space for a CB to manipulate through MP. In fact, the 
% New Keysian model here regress back towards a RBC model. 
        % In math: i_t = rho + n * pi + m * y_til_t + vt, in which 
        % i: nominal interest rate
        % rho=-ln(beta): natural rate of interest (at steady state)
        % n: elasticity of inflation 
        % pi: inflation level
        % m: elasticity of output gap
        % y_til=ln(Y)-ln(Y_fp): log deviation of output from fp path value
        % v: exogenous monetary policy shock that evolves following AR(1)
%
% Notice: One important conclusion from theory is that the Flex-Price Path 
% of Calvo Fairy Model is exactly the same as which of Rottemberg Burning 
% Model. This is because, respectively, the Flex-Price Path model equals 
    % 1.NK Rottemberg: psi=0, Charizard uses Burn-Up (喷火龙使用了燃尽)>_<;
    % 2.Calvo Fairy: thet=0, Alcremie uses Charm (霜奶仙就是正义！)(~_~);

% MODEL: 

% Claim all varibles:
var A V Y C H w MC R Pi Pi_star 
Y_fp C_fp H_fp w_fp MC_fp R_fp 
Y_til C_til H_til w_til MC_til R_til; 

% A: Homogenous Productivity;
% V: Monetary Shock
% Y: Aggregate Output Index / Final Good Production;
% C: Aggregate Consumption Index / Final Good Consumption;
% H: Aggregate Labour; 
    % in CFairy model H is the integral of intermediate firm labour demand
    % as they are ex-post hetereogenous. Meanwhile, it represents each
    % homogenous household's labour supply
% w: Real Wage;
% MC: Real Marginal Cost of intermediate good producer;
    % 1/MC is mark-up
% R: Gross Nominal Interest Rate (R = 1+i)
    %  better interpretable as percentage change under log-linearization
% Pi: Price Level in total --> Gross Inflation Pi=(1+pi)
% Pi_star: Firms Optimal Relative Pricing 
    % Pi_star=P_star(t)/P(t), represents the optimal price by firms tho are 
    % chosen by the Fairy, in other words, the monopoly price
% X_fp: corresponding varaibles under flex-price path
% X_til: the log difference between X and X_fp, absolute deviation
% Notice: 
% 1. We need to have prices all in gross ratio because in New Keysian 
    % models prices themselves are undetermined, while the ratios are. 
% 2. We do not have Pi_fp because in flex-price path they will all be 1

s       = 0.05;     % Size (and direction if negative) of Shocks  

% Notice:
% 1. sig (CRRA) can be crucial in deciding the correlation between H and Y: 
    % If sig<1, correlation (H,Y) usually is positive:
    % Because consumers are MORE elastic in intertemporal consumption, so 
    % they produce and consume more with a positive productivity shock;
    % If sig>1, correlation (H,Y) usually is negative:
    % Because consumers are LESS elastic in intertemporal consumption, so 
    % they would rather enjoy more leisure at a positive productivity shock
% 2. Computers are modest. They only report what they see. Therefore, keep
    % s small (0.05). If I magnify the shock to such a degree that it sees 
    % nothing, it says nothing. Quote from CompSci: Rubbish in, rubbsih out

% periods: how many period we want the whole simulation take;

% irf: periods we want to show impulse response over;
% order: by default, Dynare uses 2nd order appx. It generates a stochastic 
% result and the graphs actually shows average IRF, which may be quirky. 
% To see a smooth graph and the direct effect of shocks, use 1st order appx
% or reduce the size of the shock even smaller to s=0.01.
