% This model is a building block for New Keysian models. In fact, this model is the Flex-Path model where the burning cost coefficient psi = 0.

% A: Aggregate Productivity;
% Y: Aggregate Output;
% C: Aggregate Consumption;
% H: Aggregate Labour;
% w: real wage;
% MC: real marginal cost of intermediate good producer;
% Rp: denote the ratio between Gross Nominal Interest and Gross Inflation, = R/p = (1+r)/(1+pi) ; 

% The reason we do not setup R (Gross Nominal Interest) and p (Gross Inflation) is because 
% If we include both, this basic model will have more unknown than equations. 
% The intuition is that Rp as a whole represents the intertemporal price of consumption, as nominal bonds are the only saving vehicle.
% In this basic model, prices are not effecting prodcution decisions.
% As to consumer decisions, price level itself can be at random in each period. Consumer will adjust comptemporarily, as long as the ratio Rp is given.

% sig (CRRA) can be crucial in deciding the correlation between H(labour) and Y(output). 
% If sig < 1, correlation (H,Y) usually is positive:
% This is explained by the fact that consumer are MORE elastic in intertemporal consumption, so they will produce and consume more with a positive productivity shock;
% If sig > 1, correlation(H,Y) usually is negative:
% This is explained by the fact that consumer is LESS elastic in intertemporal consumption, so they would rather enjoy more leisure with a positive productivity shock;
% In this specific model, when sig = 1, H is a constant process. 

% The s is a size adjustment to the productivity shock, which is CRUCIAL to this model to be around 0.05. 
% We will DESTROY the economy if we let the shock to have variance 1. Noted the steady state output is only 1, by such a great shock the economic will never go back to norm.

%  1 for the demand for labour given the production level, as the firm side FOC. See LN1 eq(20);
%  2 for optimized marginal cost as the firm side FOC. This in turn decides the total production level, so interpreted as supply for good. See LN1 eq(21);
%  3 for labour supply as the household side FOC. See LN1 eq(5),eq(6);
%  4 for Euler Equation on intertemporal choice based on nominal bond. See LN1 eq(5),eq(7);
%  5 for good demand from household (or good market constraint). See LN1 eq(41);
%  6 for 'Phillip Curve' when psi = 0. This is to say, without money stickiness, the relative mark-up for a intermediate good producer is fixed wrt Dixit-Stiglitiz substitution effect. See LN1 3.5.1;
%  7 for technology process, with reduced size of the shock.
